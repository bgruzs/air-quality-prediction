The data loaded here is from January, but the `raw_data` directory contains data from other months of the year as well, and we'll look at the rest of this data later. We first use Pandas to read our CSV file and turn it into a DataFrame. We then filter for rows containing PM2.5 data on January 1st, 2020 at 08:00 UTC in a DataFrame named 'filtered_df', and we use the len function to see how many rows of data are in the filtered DataFrame."

    "We see that we have 25 rows in our filtered DataFrame. We can now make PM2.5 predictions using this data and our `PredictPollutant` function, which performs inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation to make predictions. In order to determine the accuracy of this interpolation method, we can make predictions of what the pollutant concentration should be in locations where we know the pollutant concentration. To do this, we create two empty lists to store the true and predicted PM2.5 concentrations. For each row in our filtered DataFrame, we take the coordinates of a location along with the true PM2.5 value at that location. We then temporarily remove that row from the DataFrame and perform IDW interpolation to predict the PM2.5 concentration using the four nearest sensors, and add the value to our predicted values list."

We can do this by creating a parity plot, which plots the actual PM2.5 concentration on the x-axis vs. the predicted PM2.5 concentration on the y-axis. Points closer to the diagonal line are better predictions, while points further from the line are worse predictions. We can also compute several statistics on the predictions, such as the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the $R^2$ values."
